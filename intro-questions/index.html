        <h1>Introductory Questions</h1>
        <ol type="1">
            <li>Lily Park, Marketing & Communication Design, Junior</li>
            <li>I am from South Korea, and I wanted to take a design class that deals with long-term projects!</li>
            <li>I do not have any experience with HTML/CSS/JS.</li>
            <li>I hope to get more familiar with some basic programming languages, and I am excited to meet with actual clients to solve real problems.</li>
            <li>Designing for a screen requires considering responsive layouts, as users can interact with elements and view the design on various devices. In contrast, designing for paper focuses more on fixed dimensions and static layouts.</li>
            <li><a href="https://dontboardme.com/" target="_blank">https://dontboardme.com/</a>: I think this website's strongest forte is its responsive design that focuses user attention. I personally think the strong visual hierarchy and the consistent color scheme with cute images and clean, legible fonts create a professional and user-friendly experience.</li>
            <li><a href="https://ranlus.fr" target="_blank">https://ranlus.fr</a>: This website exemplifies effective communication through its minimalistic layout combined with concise text and organized sections - it’s clear which section the user is on. The simple but interactive design allows users to quickly understand how to navigate the site with ease and keeps the user’s attention on essential content without any distractions.</li>
            <li><a href="https://sloshseltzer.com/" target="_blank">https://sloshseltzer.com/</a>: This website is personally very engaging and immediately captures attention while effectively conveying the brand’s lively image. This site is also very easy to navigate with its responsive design and its “clear calls to action.”</li>
