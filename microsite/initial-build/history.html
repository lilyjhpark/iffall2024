      <h1>History of Studio Ghibli</h1>
      <h2>1. Tokuma Shoten Era (1985-2005)</h2>
      <p>Studio Ghibli was officially established on June 15, 1985, by directors Hayao Miyazaki and Isao Takahata, along with producer Toshio Suzuki. Initially a subsidiary of Tokuma Shoten, the studio produced several iconic films during this period, including <i>Castle in the Sky</i> (1986), <i>My Neighbor Totoro</i> (1988), and <i>Kiki's Delivery Service</i> (1989).</p>
      <p><i>Princess Mononoke</i> (1997) marked a turning point, becoming Japan's highest-grossing film at the time and establishing Ghibli internationally. In 2001, <i>Spirited Away</i> became the highest-grossing film in Japanese history and won the Academy Award for Best Animated Feature in 2003. Studio Ghibli became independent from Tokuma Shoten in 2004.</p>

      <h2>2. Independent Era (2005-2014)</h2>
      <p>After becoming independent, Ghibli continued producing notable films such as <i>Ponyo</i> (2008) and <i>The Secret World of Arrietty</i> (2010). In 2013, Miyazaki released <i>The Wind Rises</i>, his final film before a temporary retirement. Following his announcement, Ghibli paused production, creating uncertainty about its future.</p>

      <h2>3. Nippon Television Era (2014-present)</h2>
      <p>In 2014, Nippon Television Network Corporation became Ghibli's primary shareholder. Despite Miyazaki’s retirement, Ghibli produced <i>When Marnie Was There</i> (2014) and collaborated on <i>The Red Turtle</i> (2016). In 2017, Miyazaki returned to direct <i>The Boy and the Heron</i>, released in 2023, showing Ghibli’s resilience and commitment to animation.</p>
    
      <p>Today, Studio Ghibli remains a respected institution, continuing to create unique hand-drawn animations with timeless stories and emotional depth.</p>
