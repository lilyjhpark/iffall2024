        Do you remember
        Happy together?
        I do
        Don't you?
        <br>
        Then all of a sudden
        You're sick to your stomach
        Is that
        Still true?
        <br>
        Said forever, in the end, I fought it
        Please be honest, are we better for it?
        Thought you'd hate me but instead you called and
        Said, "I miss you," I caught it
        <br>
        Good to each other
        Give it the summer
        I knew
        You too
        <br>
        But I only saw you
        Once in December
        I'm still
        Confused
        <br>
        You said forever and I almost bought it
        I miss fighting in your old apartment
        Breaking dishes when you're disappointed
        I still love you, I promise
        <br>
        Nothing happened in the way I wanted
        Every corner of this house is haunted
        And I know you said that we're not talking
        But I miss you, I'm sorry
        <br>
        I don't wanna go
        Think I'll make it worse
        Everything I know brings me back to us
        <br>
        I don't wanna go
        We been here before
        Everywhere I go leads me back to you
