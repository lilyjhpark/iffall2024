        <h2>Instructions</h2>
        <h3>Red Velvet Cupcakes</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Preheat the oven to 350F (177C) convection (325F/163C conventional) and line 14 cupcake tins with liners.</li>
            <li>In the bowl of a stand mixer or a medium-large bowl, whisk together the cake flour, cocoa powder, baking baking, salt and sugar until they're evenly distributed (whisk well).</li>
            <li>Add the oil and butter to the dry ingredients and use the whisk attachment on an electric mixer to beat the butter and oil into the dry ingredients until they're well combined. It should look kind of crumbly.</li>
            <li>Add the eggs, one at a time, beating just a few seconds before adding the next egg.</li>
            <li>Warm up the buttermilk and add the vanilla, vinegar and food coloring to it. Mix until the food coloring is fully dissolved in the buttermilk.</li>
            <li>Add the buttermilk to the batter, mixing just until it's fully combined and smooth.</li>
            <li>Distribute evenly among the cupcake tins, about 50-55 grams in each, and bake for about 18-21 minutes or until the center springs back when you press on it.</li>
            <li>Remove from the oven, let them cool for 5-10 minutes and remove them from the pan.</li>
        </ol>
        <h3>Cream Cheese Frosting</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Place the room temperature butter in the bowl of a stand mixer. Using a whisk attachment, beat the butter on medium-high speed for 1-2 minutes, until the color turns to a pale yellow.</li>
            <li>Add in the cream cheese and beat at medium speed for a minute, just until they're combined</li>
            <li>Add the powdered sugar and salt and mix on low speed, just until it's combined. Turn the mixer to medium-high speed and beat the buttercream for 2-3 minutes, until all of the sugar is fully dissolved and the buttercream no longer feels gritty.</li>
            <li>Pour in 3 tablespoons of heavy whipping cream and vanilla bean paste and beat for another 1-2 minutes on high speed.</li>
        </ol>

        <ul class="review-list">
            <li><a href="https://baranbakery.com/red-velvet-cupcakes/#h-step-by-step-instructions">Baran Bakery</a>: This site's design is minimalistic and functional, using bold headings and a clean layout that allows the recipe instructions to be the focus. The lack of unnecessary visuals ensures that users are not distracted, while the straightforward typography and organized layout make the instructions easy to follow. This simple, content-first design was a major factor in choosing it for my project.</li>
            <li><a href="https://www.browneyedbaker.com/red-velvet-cupcakes-cream-cheese-frosting/">Brown Eyed Baker</a>: The design of Brown Eyed Baker has a clean and straightforward design, with ample white space and clear typography that prioritizes readability. The simplicity makes it easy to navigate, but it lacks the visual engagement of other sites like Preppy Kitchen. While effective, the design may feel a little plain for users looking for more visually interactive elements.</li>
            <li><a href="https://preppykitchen.com/red-velvet-cupcakes/">Preppy Kitchen</a>: Preppy Kitchen’s design excels in combining vibrant, high-quality images with easy-to-read text, creating a visually engaging user experience. The site’s modern fonts and bright colors add to its polished look. However, the heavy focus on visuals might overwhelm users seeking more straightforward, text-focused instructions, compared to the simpler approach of Baran Bakery.</li>

Additionally, its focus on highlighting creative work with a simple interface might inspire me to make my own design both intuitive and striking.</li>
            <li><a href="https://www.rustic-jp.com/">Rustic Japan</a>: The website features a harmonious blend of typography and imagery that creates a consistent, calming aesthetic. The serif font choice fits perfectly with the soft, natural tones of the imagery, providing a cohesive look.

The consistent color palette and elegant font pairing offer a sense of unity, which could influence my approach to ensuring that typography and visuals complement each other in my design.</li>
            <li><a href="https://besmoke.com/">BeSmoke</a>: This site uses a refined, visually appealing design with large imagery, bold typography, and a simple color palette.
