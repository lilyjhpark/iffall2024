        <h2>Step-by-Step Instructions</h2>
        <h3>Red Velvet Cupcakes with Cream Cheese Frosting</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Step 1: Make the cupcakes by whisking together the flour, cocoa powder, sugar, baking soda and salt until they're evenly distributed.</li>
            <li>Step 2: Add the butter and oil one at a time and mix just until the dry ingredients are fully coated with the fats. Don’t over-mix.  </li>
            <li>Step 3: Add the eggs, one at a time, with the mixer on low speed and mix just until the eggs are incorporated and the batter looks like paste.</li>
            <li>Step 4: Dissolve the food coloring in the milk with the vanilla, and then stream it into the batter with the mixer on low speed (or do a little at a time, in 3-4 increments, if using a hand mixer). Mix just until it's incorporated.</li>
            <li>Step 5:Distribute the batter evenly among the cupcake 14 tins, about 50-55 grams in each tin.</li>
            <li>Step 6: Bake for about 18-20 minutes. When the cupcakes are done baking, they will spring back when you press on the center. Remove from the oven and allow to cool for 5-10 minutes before removing from the pan. Allow them to cool to room temperature.</li>

            <li>Step 7: Make the frosting by creaming the butter and cream cheese together until they're well combined and have lightened in color a bit.</li>
            <li>Step 8: Add the powdered sugar, vanilla and salt and beat at a low speed just until the sugar is combined. Scrape the edge of the bowl and increase the speed to medium for 1-2 minutes while streaming in the heavy whipping cream.</li>
            <li>Step 9:Frost the cupcakes once they've cooled. If the frosting is soft, just refrigerate it for 20-30 minutes before piping.</li>
